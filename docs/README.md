## Other Features

### Posting welcome texts

The Bot will respond to any message containing the phrases "met gauss" or "meet gauss" by posting a configured message.

If that same message has been posted previously, the bot will edit it to contain just:

> [This previously contained the welcome message]

To avoid a long trail of potentially very large messages clogging the channel.

The message can be configured with `!g admin welcome message <text>` and `!g admin welcome channel <channelId>` by a moderator. [See here for more information.](./admin/README.md#admin-welcome-message)

### Clickable subreddit links

Gauss will, in certain channels, automatically generate clickable links to mentioned subreddits.

For example, if a user mentions /r/University_of_Bayes, Gauss will respond like this:

> Here is a clickable link: https://www.reddit.com/r/University_of_Bayes

Gauss will also warn about subreddits marked as NSFW and not provide clickable links for those subreddits.
